    "<h1><center>Module 1: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks</center></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language known for its ease of reading and widely active community. It is a solid general-purpose language which is friendly to beginners, especially in the form of its syntax. This module will walk through the basics of Python installation, the installation of the Sublime Text editor, as well as the use and installation of Jupyter Notebooks (Where this module was written, if being viewed in PDF form). This will be structured assuming the operator is running on a Linux machine, but the process will be generally the same across all platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be downloaded and installed similar to most any other programs you would typically install on your machine. For these modules Python 3 will be employed (particularly Python 3.6.8). You can visit the following [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the most up to date version pertaining to your operating system. Typically, if you are on a Linux machine Python will be installed with your distribution. You can check your version of Python with the following command: \n",
    "<pre><code>$ python3 --version </code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the command is not found and you are running Ubuntu, use the following commands to install Python, where X.X represent the target version (for these modules, I would recommend 3.6):\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install pythonX.X</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are installing Python version 3.4 or later, it will also include 'pip' which is the package installer for Python. This allows you to install useful packages which allow access to predefined methods which make programming much easier. More on this later!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with Python installed you should be able to open a terminal and issue the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>$ python3</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This should grant access to the default Python interpretor (also known as the Python Shell). From here, simple commands can be issued on a line by line basis. For example, lets carry out a simple math problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>>>> x = 10\n",
    ">>> y = 2\n",
    ">>> x+y</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two lines initialize integer variables (10,2) and the final line tells the interpretor to add the two variables together and return the result (12). To exit the intepretor, press Ctrl+z if on a Linux machine to return to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Installing Sublime Text Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "As I am sure you noticed, working with the default interpretor is interesting but impractical. This is where text editors come in - programs which allow you to write out and issue multiples lines of code in the form of scripts (.py files). There are many text editors available on the internet such as VI, Atom, Sublime, and Eclipse, however the following steps will outline the installation and use of Sublime. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install Sublime, follow this [link](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and select the link for your operating system. If you are running Ubuntum, the following commands will install Sublime:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>$ wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n",
    "\n",
    "$ echo \"deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list\n",
    "\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install sublime-text</code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of the Sublime Text editor should now be installed on your machine, and should be visible with your other applications. When opened, you should be greeted with the following black screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/sub.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Sublime has immense customization options, so make sure to poke around the Preferences tab to make it your own. With Sublime installed, Python scripts can be written and built! This is entirely offline, meaning you can write, test, and compile Python scripts on the go. The following is the typical beginner Python script written in Sublime:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/hw.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the colors in the above picture are likely different from those on your screen. That is because the above is saved as a .py file which Sublime registers as a Python script. Knowing this allows Sublime to color code each phrase corresponding to how the interpretor will read it. These can be customized via the Preferences tab if you so choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once written and saved, this program can be build via Sublimes Python Interpretor by pressing Ctrl+b. The following should be your result:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/hwB.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have now compiled your first Python script! The results of the script are displayed in the window below the editor, along with the time required to run that script. You can also run compiled Pyton scripts via the Terminal by opening a Terminal in the directory of your .py file and issuing the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>$ python3 XXX.py </code></pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the results will be displayed in the Terminal window should you print/return them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Linux Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you should have issued some commands via the Terminal in your Linux distribution that you likely have not understood fully. This section will help to familiarize yourself with navigating the Terminal and most Linux distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ubuntu, you can open a Terminal via searching your Applications and selecting \"Terminal\", or you can use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+t. Once open, you are presented with the following window:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/tm.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be an interface that you grow accustomed to seeing and working with. Many of the commands you have utilized so far have involved the term 'sudo' at the beginning. To the Terminal, this translates to \"Super user do\", which in Windows speak means \"Run as administrator\". This is typically required for any command which will download or install a package, or edit files that are in protected directories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before there were file explorers, there were Terminals. This means that you can navigate through directories, open/create/remove directories, and open/create/remove files. Below is a list of typical commands that you will use frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Purpose                                                               | Example               |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| ls      | List contents of current directory                                    | \\$ls                   |\n",
    "| cd      | Change directory                                                      | \\$cd Desktop           |\n",
    "| cd ..   | Move up one directory                                                 | \\$cd ..                |\n",
    "| pwd     | Print working directory                                               |  \\$pwd                 |\n",
    "| mkdir   | Make directory, either at the current location or specified directory | \\$mkdir Test           |\n",
    "| touch   | Create an empty file with the given name and path                     | \\$touch /path/filename |\n",
    "| nano    | If Nano is installed, open and edit the target file                   | \\$nano Test.txt        |\n",
    "| rm      | Delete a file                                                         |  \\$rm filename         |\n",
    "| rmdir   | Delete an empty directory                                             | \\$rmdir Test           |\n",
    "| rm -r   | Delete a directory and all its contents                               | \\$rm -r Test           |\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin honing your Linux skills, create a folder in your Documents directory for these Modules. Title it whatever you like, but only use the command line interface to create and navigate to that directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Local text editors are great for writing personal scripts to accomplish tasks, but as a form of deliverable or manual it can become taxing to understand at first glance. Jupyter Notebooks allows for a more seamless integration of code and text explanations through various Cells, utilizing Markdown alongside Python to deliver more comprehensive deliverables. In fact, all of the Modules you will work through have been written in Jupyter Notebooks with a Python3 compiler!\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Jupyter Notebooks is relatively straightforward, and similar to the preceeding sections. On Linux machines, make sure to install ipython and then can utilize pip to install jupyter via the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get -y install ipython ipython-notebook\n",
    "$ pip install jupyter</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, issue the following command in the Terminal window while in your custom directory to arrive at a screen similar to the following:\n",
    " \n",
    "<pre><code>$ jupyter notebook </pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/jn.png\" width=\"500\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be opened in a Terminal browser, or that of your default Web browser depending on your personal settings. You have not created a Notebook yet, just opened Jupyters file explorer where you can navigate your file system, make directories, rename files, and most importantly, create Jupyter Notebooks. When you are in your target directory, select \"New\" in the upper right hand corner, followed by \"Python 3\". You have now created and opened your first Jupyter Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/jnF.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The above Figure shows the typical Jupyter Notebook, with the first cell always being a Code cell. In these cells you can write Python code directly, and use Shift+Enter to run the cell. This is the same setup as the Sublime Text Editor, but without a Build window and different keyboard shortcut. You can always distinguish a Code cell by the dropdown in the center of the header bar, as well as with the 'In' designating 'Input'. In addition to Code cells there are Markdown cells, which allow for the formatting of text in a specified syntax that is used around various programs online (LaTex being a notable example). This module thus far has been written in a Markdown cell! You can switch between cell types via the dropdown menu in the middle of the header bar. Markdown is really a skill that can only be learned with time and cheatsheets, the [following of which has been a favorite of mine.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Back to Python: Variables and Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the fundamental tools installed, it is time to begin actually learning Python. The following skills will be relatively consistent between most computer languages, differing mainly in the syntax. Now that you have Jupyter notebooks installed, I would recommend opening the Jupyter notebook version of this Module and working through the following examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5.1 Variables\n",
    "In Python you will mainly interface with variables to accomplish your tasks. There are two main types of variables that are common throughout most languages:\n",
    "* Numbers\n",
    "* Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5.1.1 Numbers\n",
    "Numbers are created just as you would imagine: x = 1, y = 2, etc. However, not all numbers are created equal in Python. Primarily, you will interact with Integers and Floats: the difference being Integers are whole numbers whereas Floats involve decimals. So, x = 1 is an Integer whereas x = 1.0 is a Float. This seems pretty straightforward, however remembering this distinction as you program can be important while debugging. Some functions will only accept Integers as inputs, so keeping track of what's what is worthwhile. Run the following cell to see an example of this:"

These indicate comments in the code, which means they are similar in function to Markdown cells but without the formatting capabilities. These lines will not be run by the interpretor when compiling the code, but can be read by the coder for informational purposes. In Jupyter Notebooks, lines can be commented out by highlighting them and pressing Ctrl+/, and uncommented through the same procedure. Commenting your code is incredibly helpful when you hand off your deliverables to others so they can more readily understand what the purpose of each line is. \n",

For this block we are only interested in summing the values, so this is a valid method. The second For loop accesses each element in xRange via its index through the iteration variabel 'i', which is initialized at i=0 and increase in value by 1 every time the loop completes until it reaches the end of the range (which in this case is the length of xRange).\n",

    "Another benefit of Python is its support of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Essentially, this means that rather than having a single .py file that contains an immense number of lines of code, you can break that into different classes which contain specific methods. Those classes contain methods that are particular to the specific class, and your main .py then imports those classes to utilize those methods. This may seem convoluted, but the idea behind this is to use the classes to initialize instances of your written classes for various scenarios (known as Objects). Whole books have been written on Object Oriented Programming so I won't dive deep on this topic, but the overall gist is to use Classes as the backbone for which many Objects can be created. For example, you may have a Buffer class which takes in a CSV, formats it into a shapefile, and applies a certain buffer distance to it. Each of those steps would be methods within the Buffer class, but the CSV you pass in and Shapefile you create would be an instance of that class and therefore be an Object. These terms apply to GIS processing, but the methodology can be applied to any number of use cases. Classes then are additional .py files which contain methods that pertain to the purpose of the class.\n",

However, the API's per well in this file are only API-8's, meaning they do not contain the state code for Colorado (08). In order for these wells to be linked to additional datasets, an API-10 must be generated. Additionally, as this data is accumulated from multiple different datasources there are errors in the API data; particularly, some will already have an '05' or '5' prepended, and some may contain dashes which need to be removed (total character count needs to equal 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Task:** Work with the data read in from \"Wells.csv\" to generate API-10s for each horizontal well bore and write that to the file. Below I have read in the data from the csv utilizing a package in Python called NumPy (called via np.XXX) which you will utilize greatly the more you interact with Python."
