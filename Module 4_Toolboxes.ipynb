    "\n",
    "By now you should have an understanding of how to utilize the Python window in ArcMap to handle geoprocessing tasks, however these are rather inconvenient to employ on a case to case basis. Even as standalone scripts, you would typically be required to close the mapping document, run your script through a command prompt window, and then reopen the map document to analyze your results. Rather than working in such a clunky fashion, we can instead create our own Python Toolboxes which can be run within ArcMap as our own custom geoprocessing tools. This module outlines the procedure for creating custom Python Toolboxes, installing them in your instance of ArcMap, and the process for automating these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Toolboxes\n",
    "If you have not already, go ahead and open the ArcToolbox from within an instance of ArcMap. This can be done with the red toolbox button next to our commonly used \"Python Window\" button on the toolbar. You should be presented with the following side panel:\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/toolbox.JPG\" width=1000px>\n",
    "\n",
    "From here you can access all of the predefined tools, of which all of the code driven tools in previous modules are available. From these interfaces you can interact with all of the tools in a programmatic manner identical to the way they are laid out in the ArcPy documentation. A prime example is the \"Add Field\" tool found under the \"Data Management Tools\" and \"Fields\" sub category as shown:\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/addfield.JPG\" width=1000px>\n",
    "\n",
    "These prompts are incredibly useful for using these tools on the fly, but can become burdensome when running multiple operations in sequence - especially when you plan to run that procedure multiples times or on a standardized basis. You can also access the ArcToolbox through the \"Catalog\" which is typically snapped to the right hand side of the ArcMap screen. From this view, you also have access to \"My Toolboxes\" where you can create your own subdirectory of Tools that you may use more frequently than others. However, we are most interested in creating our own Python Toolbox which can be accomplished by right clicking \"My Toolboxes\", \"New\", \"Python Toolbox\":\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/pybox.png\" width=1000px>\n",
    "Once created, you can view the prewritten code for that toolbox by right clicking your new toolbox name and selecting \"Edit\". Typically, this will open the code in a native text editor which may not be the easiest to interact with. I would recommend locating the actual toolbox location and opening with Sublime. The toolboxes are typically saved in a somewhat secluded file location along the lines of \"C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\ESRI\\Desktop10.7\\ArcToolbox\\My Toolboxes\\\", however you can view the saved location by once again right clicking your custom toolbox and selecting properties. Once found and opened you should be presented with a similar looking series of code blocks:\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/pyboxpre.JPG\" width=1000px>\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no syntactic highlights present, you may need to instruct Sublime to treat the syntax as Python code as the .pyt extension confuses the interpreter. This can be accomplished through: \"View\", \"Syntax\", \"Python\". As you can see there are multiple different functions and two seperate classes within this default Python Toolbox. The Toolbox class initiates a Toolbox object which houses all of your tools, and the Tool class initiates an object per Tool you would like to employ. As an example, you may consider the \"Fields\" toolset from earlier as the \"Toolbox\" object, and the \"Add Field\" operation would be the \"Tool\" object. This comes back to the concept of object oriented coding discussed in Module 1: In this case, the Toolbox object is initiated for each series of opertions you would like to conduct, and each Tool object can be tailored to the specific Feature Class being operated upon. This helps to segment the code and allow the operations to remain generally applicable to multiple different scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Understanding Python Toolboxes\n",
    "Most of the Toolbox class is self-explanatory and does not require much editing beyond supplying a name and updating the Tool list with as many tools as you create. The Tool class is where the real customization takes place. The \"def \\_\\_init_\\_\\\" method is known as the **constructor** in the Python world and houses the attributes that are inherent to that specific class. In this instance, the constructor contains the name of the Tool, its description, and determines if it can be run in the background of ArcMap. I would recommend preventing running in the background while you are still experimenting with Python Toolboxes as it can be difficult to gauge the effectiveness of your scripts if you allow it to run in the background without your monitoring its progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"getParameterInfo\" method is what facilitates the popup window you saw when examining the \"Add Field\" tool from within ArcMap. This is the method which defines each parameter required for the tool to operate, and passes that information on to the tool for the following operations. There is a multitude of different parameters you can create, and each parameter you define has its own list of parameters required to intantiate it. See [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/geoprocessing_and_python/defining-parameters-in-a-python-toolbox.htm) for the documentation page relating to parameters, and the below code block as a brief example of how you may choose to pass in the \"Directional_Lines\" shapefile for some of the operations we have run in the past:"

The more complicated your Tools become, the more difficult and time consuming it is to author numerous lines of untested code in the Toolbox, refresh your results in ArcMap, run through your parameters, then debug your errors when they inevitably hit. Save yourself some time by trial running your procedures in the Python Window. Once you have finished your trial run, remember that the main difference in working in the Toolbox vs the Python Window is **clearly establishing your Mapping Document and your workspace.** If you are still in anyway uncertain about the definition of your workspace, how to define it, or when to use relative vs absolute paths make sure to revisit Module 2.

In order to do this, the tools need to be set to run on a schedule (particularly when the computer is not being used, such as in the early hours of the morning). If you are on a Windows computer (such as in the computer labs at CSM) you may choose to interface with the Windows Task Scheduler which can be found by searching for \"Task Scheduler\" in the Windows Search Bar.\n",

The Task Scheduler also allows for custom tasks to be scheduled to be run at specified times through the \"Create Basic Task...\" prompt located in the right pane. Once you have given your task a Name and Description, you will be prompted for the frequency that the task should be executed. For our testing purposes, choose \"One Time\", and then specify a time a few minutes from when you are setting up this Task so you have enough time to finish the setup. For this example, choose an arbitrary time as we are not going to actually schedule a Task at this time. For the \"Action\" choose \"Start a program\", and you should be presented with the following prompt:\n",

    "Because we are intending for this Task to execute a geoprocessing tool without requiring ArcMap being open, we need to specify the absolute path for the python.exe that ArcMap utilizes. This is the same path as found in section 1.6 of Module 3, so refer back to your notes or the Module itself for that path. Once located, this goes in the \"Program/script\" input field as the executable. For the \"Add Arguments\" input field, enter the absolute path to the location of the script you wish to run contained within double quotation marks. Just like in section 1.6 o Module 3, we are first specifying the version of Python we want to utilize, followed by the .py script we intend to employ. **Note:** you cannot point to your Python Toolbox as the script you would like to execute due to the nature of how the Toolbox is structured. It is designed to be a guided toolset called from within ArcMap, not as a standalone script. In order to execute your tools outside of ArcMap, a few modifications must be made along with some .py script files.\n",

    "Briefly explained in section 1.6 of Module 3, you can execute scripts outside of the ArcMap environment by saving your operations in a .py file utilizing absolute paths to your mapping document. One key aspect which was included in authoring the Tools in the Toolbox we created earlier were the role of parameters, and how we handled setting, updating, and passing those to the Tools. In many cases while programming, parameters are important in making sure that your tools/scripts can be run on a multitude of inputs and in a variety of scenarios. However, when working with the Task Scheduler I would argue that hardcoding your inputs and outputs in your script would be more beneficial. The main reasonsing being future modifications can be handled from within the script, meaning you only need to interact with the Scheduler once. As the goal of scheduling these Tasks is to handle repetitive operations without our input, for most cases this involves a consistent series of inputs/outputs which are conducive for hard coding.\n",
